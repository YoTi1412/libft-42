# Libft

## Usage

- Run `make` to compile the library without bonus functions.
- Run `make bonus` to compile the library with bonus functions.

## Concept

Libft is a foundational project in the 42 curriculum designed to help students develop a deeper understanding of the C programming language and prepare them for more advanced coding challenges. The project focuses on creating a custom library of C functions, similar to the standard C library (libc), which will be reusable in future projects.

### Key Objectives:

1. **Reimplement Standard Functions**  
   Replicate a variety of functions from `<string.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, and `<ctype.h>` such as `memset`, `strlen`, `strcpy`, `atoi`, `isalpha`, and more. This helps reinforce knowledge of pointers, memory allocation, and string manipulation.

2. **Custom Utility Functions**  
   Implement additional functions not found in the standard library but commonly needed in programming, such as `ft_strjoin`, `ft_split`, and `ft_itoa`.

3. **Linked List Manipulation**  
   Extend the library with bonus functions to work with linked lists. This involves creating, modifying, and traversing a linked list, which is crucial for mastering dynamic data structures.

4. **Code Modularity**  
   Learn to write reusable and modular code by breaking down tasks into separate, well-documented functions.

5. **Preparation for Larger Projects**  
   Use Libft as a foundational tool in future projects, ensuring a strong base for tasks requiring efficient and optimized custom functions.

Libft emphasizes clean coding practices, memory management, and understanding the inner workings of common C library functions. Completing this project equips students with essential tools and skills for tackling complex programming challenges.
